We know each other since the start of third year and are used to work together.
We are complementary.

## Project presentation
For the first level 2 mobile development project of this year, we are coding a native android app with Kotlin.
We have to foolow the good practices of an android and kotlin project.
- [X] Customize color in App bar 
- [X] Change the launcher icon 
- [X] Add a language 
- [X] Use of string.xml (/!\ hard coded var /!) 
- [X] Coherence in naming convention

### Tools 
We are using Android Studio Electrical Eel (Be careful if you're not using this version, there could be some compatibility issues)
We are compiling in Android 33, our target is Android 33


### Architecture 
We have a home page as well as a page to gain access to our awesome quiz that will reveal which Hogwart house you belong to !
During this quiz, you will answer to a number of questions in order to discover if you are a ~~Slytherin~~ or a Gryffindor :)

We are using the differents widgets available for android to build a complete form :
- RadioButton
- EditText
- Image
- CheckBox
- Switch
- Spinner

Each answer is worth a certain amnount of points, that's how we can determine which is yours !

### Showtime
Here is a simple demonstration of how the app is designed to be used, starting from the home screen to the end result :
