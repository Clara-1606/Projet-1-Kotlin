### Tools 
We are using Android Studio Electrical Eel (Be careful if you're not using this version, there could be some compatibility issues)
We are compiling in Android 33, our target is Android 33


### Architecture 
We have a home page as well as a page to gain access to our awesome quiz that will reveal which Hogwart house you belong to !
During this quiz, you will answer to a number of questions in order to discover if you are a ~~Slytherin~~ or a Gryffindor :)

We are using the differents widgets available for android to build a complete form :
- RadioButton
- EditText
- Image
- CheckBox
- Switch
- Spinner

Each answer is worth a certain amnount of points, that's how we can determine which is yours !
